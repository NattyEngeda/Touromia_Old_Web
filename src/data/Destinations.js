Located on the outskirts of the city of Jimma, the capital of the region, the current Palace was built by King Aba Jifar II in the 1880s on a site located seven kilometers north of Jimma and chosen by the King’s father. At 2,000 meters above sea level, the site was selected for its commanding location, from which it was possible to monitor enemy movements, and because it was above the malaria-prone low lands of the town center. The Kingdom of Jimma grew to prominence due to its control of the caravan routes with the Kingdom of Kaffa to the south, and its connection to ports on the northern Somali coast, which linked it to major trade routes crossing the Indian Ocean. King Aba Jifar II’s father was the first ruler of Jimma to embrace Islam. The Oromia Region is now predominantly Muslim, and the Palace is considered a symbol of the origin of Islam in the region.'},
